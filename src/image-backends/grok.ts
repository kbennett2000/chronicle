/** Shells out to `grok -p "/imagine ..."` headlessly (design doc §2.2), locates

 * Never throws — every failure mode (Grok Build not installed/authenticated,
 * timeout, unparseable output, no locatable image file) is caught and returned
 * as a clear failure result, since an image is best-effort per §8 and must never
 * block a turn from completing.
 *
 * Issue #60 (the real fix): Grok Build is a full agentic *coding* assistant, not
 * a bare image endpoint. Run before with `--cwd <campaignDir>` — which lives
 * INSIDE this git repo — it would read a stray prompt (e.g. leaked DM planning
 * chatter like "let me read the campaign files") as a coding task, explore src/,
 * edit files, and even `git commit`/`git push` to master on its own (that is how
 * rogue commit 0982eb6 landed). The prompt was also polluted with that same
 * meta-chatter instead of a scene description. So we now:
 *   1. run Grok in a throwaway temp dir with NO repo to touch (isolation is the
 *      real safety boundary — Grok can't wreck a repo that isn't there);
 *   2. `--deny` the mutating tools as defense-in-depth;
 *   3. strip meta-chatter from the description so the prompt is a scene, not an
 *      instruction — which also cuts latency (issue #58): a clean prompt in an
 *      empty dir generates in ~15-20s vs. minutes spent "exploring" the repo.
 * Do NOT restore `--cwd campaignDir`, and do NOT add `--effort` (it maps to
 * reasoningEffort, which grok-composer-2.5-fast rejects with a 400).
 *
 * `execFn` is injectable (default = real execFile) so tests drive it with a stub
 * and no subprocess, mirroring runGrokTurn(args, execFn) in src/backends/. */
