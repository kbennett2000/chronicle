# ADR-0018: Pluggable DM-Engine Backend (Claude + Grok)

## Status
Accepted and **implemented** (Slices 0–7, issues #77–#87). Slice 0's
validation-spike evidence is recorded below; the two items it deferred were
confirmed in build: **MCP-server reachability** (Slice 3, #80 — the four host
tools run as stdio MCP servers wired per-turn via `.grok/config.toml`) and
**SRD reads / rules adjudication under the sandbox** (Slice 4, #81). A player
selects the engine per campaign in Settings / New Chronicle (Slice 6, #87), and
`npm run verify:grok-parity` drives a scratch campaign end-to-end (Slice 7).

## Context
The DM engine — narration, 5e adjudication, and the per-turn state-file update
discipline (ADR-0001) — runs only on the Claude Agent SDK (`query()` in
`src/dm-engine.ts`). Grok is used solely for images (ADR-0009). The product
owner wants a per-campaign **Settings option to switch the DM brain between
Claude and Grok**, at **full feature parity** (the four host tools the DM uses —
dice, seed-based anti-repetition, texture tables, in-turn image generation),
offering **both Grok models** (`grok-build`, `grok-composer-2.5-fast`), surfaced
as a **provider toggle** in the "THE ENGINE" settings section that mirrors the
existing per-campaign, session-resetting model semantics.

The dominant risk was unproven: whether Grok, driven headlessly, would actually
follow Chronicle's strict per-turn "read state → narrate → update every affected
file" discipline well enough to be playable, and whether it could be confined
safely — Grok is a full agentic coder that once ran `git commit`/`git push` on
its own when pointed at this repo (issue #60), and a DM turn *must* write inside
`campaignDir`, which lives inside the repo, so the empty-temp-dir isolation that
made image-gen safe is unavailable here.

## Decision
Introduce a `DmBackend` abstraction. Both providers implement
`runTurn(args): Promise<TurnResult>` returning the **unchanged** `TurnResult`
`{text, sessionId, isError, model, requestedModel}`, so `src/server.ts` stays
provider-agnostic below a single dispatch line. `provider` becomes a
per-campaign field in `campaign-settings.json`, excluded from the settings PATCH
type exactly like `model` — it changes only via `POST /session/start`, which
resets the session (no silent mid-story adjudication shift; generalizes the #57
model-switch guard to reset when **either** provider or model changes). The four
host tools are ported to standalone stdio MCP servers reusing the existing pure
functions. Grok is invoked headlessly, confined by `--sandbox workspace` plus
tool-removal and a pre-tool-use hook.

## Slice 0 validation spike — evidence (grok CLI v0.2.82, model `grok-build`)
A throwaway spike ran two turns (opening + a resumed player action) on a
disposable scratch campaign using the **real** `systemPrompt()`, watching
`git status` throughout. Results:

- **Prompt delivery — SOLVED better than planned.** grok has
  `--system-prompt-override` (a true *replace*, mapped from Claude Code's
  `--system-prompt`), not just the append-only `--rules`. The ~11K–13K DM prompt
  is passed whole via `--system-prompt-override`, so **Grok's 10,000-char
  AGENTS.md cap is irrelevant** and no persona/prompt split is needed. Delivered
  11,082 chars with no truncation; adherence confirms it was received in full.
- **State-file writes land, discipline followed.** Turn 1 (opening) rewrote
  `world-state.md`'s Current Situation and appended the session log. Turn 2 (a
  search) correctly updated `character-sheet.json` — added the found item and
  raised gold — and the session log. Grok read and edited the campaign files via
  its own file tools under the sandbox.
- **Adherence is playable.** Present-tense narration grounded in the exact
  character sheet (halfling rogue, gear, the circled-room map), coherent across
  turns, clean of meta-chatter, one hook, no menu options.
- **Sandbox + anti-rogue-commit — SOLVED and stronger than planned.**
  `--sandbox workspace` = *read everywhere, write only to CWD (`campaignDir`) +
  `/tmp` + `~/.grok`*. So (a) SRD (`reference/srd`, outside `campaignDir`,
  ADR-0006) is **readable by construction** — the planned `--allow`/SRD-copy
  workaround is unnecessary; and (b) the repo `.git` and `src/` (outside the
  campaign-dir CWD) are **not writable**, blocking the rogue-commit at the
  filesystem layer. Plus `--disallowed-tools run_terminal_cmd` removes the
  terminal tool entirely. Post-spike `git status` showed Grok modified **no**
  tracked repo file, created nothing under `src/`/`docs/`, and never touched
  `.git`. All writes landed inside the gitignored scratch campaign.
- **Session continuity works.** `--session-id <uuid>` creates; `--resume <uuid>`
  resumes; the `sessionId` is echoed in the JSON. Turn 2 resumed and held
  continuity (same scene/NPCs). Maps 1:1 onto the existing `.session-id`
  persist/resume.
- **Headless output.** `--output-format json` → `{text, stopReason, sessionId,
  requestId}`; `.text` is the clean narration (file edits are disk side
  effects). `stopReason=EndTurn` on success.
- **Performance.** ~116s and ~151s per turn with `grok-build` — slower than
  trivial but comparable to Claude's minutes-long turns; acceptable for solo
  play. `grok-composer-2.5-fast` may be quicker.

**Gate verdict: PASS.** The dominant risks (prompt fit, discipline adherence,
safe confinement, resume) are resolved empirically. Two not fully spiked and
carried into later slices as validation steps: **MCP-server reachability**
(Slice 3 — grok documents stdio MCP via `config.toml`; not yet exercised) and
**SRD reads under real rules adjudication** (Slice 4 — enabled by the workspace
sandbox, but not driven by a combat/rules turn in the spike).

## Consequences
- **Grok invocation shape** (finalized from the spike): `grok -p <userInput>
  --cwd <campaignDir> -m <model> --output-format json --system-prompt-override
  <systemPrompt> --sandbox workspace --disallowed-tools run_terminal_cmd
  --always-approve --no-plan --no-subagents --disable-web-search` with
  `--session-id <uuid>` (new) or `--resume <uuid>`. **No `--effort`** (both grok
  models reject reasoningEffort — image-generator.ts:174).
- **For Grok, requested-vs-actual model collapses** (`model = requestedModel`)
  — the JSON carries no per-message model echo like Claude's. `modelsMatch`
  still holds trivially.
- Plan risks #2 (10K prompt cap) and #3 (sandbox vs SRD) are **retired** by
  `--system-prompt-override` and `--sandbox workspace`. Remaining risks: Grok
  rules-adherence at scale (mitigated — the per-campaign, session-resetting
  selector lets a player fall back to Claude anytime).
- **Seed registry under the sandbox (resolved in Slice 5, #86):** the shared
  anti-repetition registry (`campaigns/_registry/content-registry.md`) is a
  sibling *outside* `campaignDir`, so `--sandbox workspace` blocks it. A Grok
  turn therefore writes a *per-campaign* registry at
  `<campaignDir>/content-registry.md` (the seed stdio server passes
  `localRegistry=true`; the existing scratch-campaign redirect generalized). A
  Grok campaign dedups against its own history; Claude campaigns keep the global
  registry. This also sidesteps the earlier cross-process write-race concern for
  Grok, since its registry is campaign-local rather than shared.
- This extends ADR-0002 (permission scope: the sandbox + pre-tool-use hook are
  the Grok-side enforcement), ADR-0004 (per-turn `.grok/config.toml` + live
  settings reads re-establish "no cross-campaign bleed" out-of-process),
  ADR-0006 (SRD grant, now via read-everywhere sandbox), and ADR-0008
  (deterministic host-side permission — replicated in a `.grok/hooks/`
  pre-tool-use script sharing one confinement policy with the Claude gate).

## Alternatives considered
- **`--rules` append + AGENTS.md split** for the prompt — rejected once
  `--system-prompt-override` was found; the split duplicated the DM contract
  across two mechanisms and risked drift.
- **`--sandbox strict`** — rejected: it confines *reads* to CWD, which would
  block SRD; `workspace` confines only writes, which is exactly the boundary
  needed.
- **Copying SRD into each campaign dir** to satisfy a stricter sandbox —
  unnecessary given `workspace` reads everywhere.

## Postscript — intermittent silent Grok turn (issue #100, 2026-07)
Playtesting surfaced Grok games that "don't start": with images generating fine,
the opening scene never rendered. Root cause: `grok-build` (agent
`grok-build-plan`) is an agentic *coding* model that **intermittently** completes
a DM turn through tool/file side-effects alone — reading state, editing files,
generating images — and ends the turn with an **empty `.text`** (no narration).
The backend treated empty narration as an engine error and the `/opening` route
discards errored turns, so the campaign stayed at 0 turns. Because it is
probabilistic (four controlled repro runs all narrated; only a real production
run went silent), the Slice-0 spike and single parity runs never caught it — so
the earlier claim that `.text` is *always* the clean narration was optimistic.

**Mitigation (kept model-agnostic):** `runGrokTurn` now **retries once** on an
empty/unparseable turn, resuming the session the first attempt created
(`--resume`) with a prose-forcing nudge appended to the user input ("Write the
scene now as narrated prose in your reply text. Do not answer only through tool
calls or file edits."). Only if the retry is *also* silent does it fall through
to the existing `isError`/502 behavior (leave the campaign at 0 turns so
re-entering Play retries cleanly). `grok-build` stays the recommended Grok
default — it narrates well the large majority of the time, and the retry covers
the tail. Regression-guarded by `tests/grok-backend-retry.test.ts`.
