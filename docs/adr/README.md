# Architecture Decision Records

Every architecturally significant decision in Chronicle gets an ADR here,
numbered sequentially, written before or alongside the implementation rather
than after it. **Read [`0001-core-architecture.md`](0001-core-architecture.md)
first** — it establishes the file-backed DM engine and decoupled asset worker
that everything else builds on.

Where an ADR and `docs/design/chronicle-design-doc.md` disagree, **the ADR
wins**: the design doc is the original v0.1 planning artifact, while these
record what was actually decided and built.

## Conventions

- **Numbering is contiguous.** Take the next free number; don't reuse one and
  don't leave gaps. (This index is generated by reading the files, so a new ADR
  shows up here once it exists — but the table above is committed text, so
  regenerate or hand-add the row when you add one.)
- An ADR is **immutable once Accepted**. To change a decision, write a new ADR
  that supersedes it and update the old one's status to point forward.
  ADR-0003 → ADR-0019 is the worked example.
- Small clarifications that don't reverse the decision can go in-place, in a
  clearly labelled amendment section — see ADR-0030's reliability amendment.
- Two status formats exist, for no better reason than history: 0001–0033 use a
  `## Status` heading block, 0034 onward use an inline `Status:` / `Date:` pair.
  Either is fine; match the neighbours.
